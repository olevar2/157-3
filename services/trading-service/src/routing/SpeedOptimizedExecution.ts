/**
 * Speed Optimized Execution
 * Focuses on minimizing latency at every step of the order lifecycle.
 * May involve co-location, optimized network paths, and lean messaging protocols.
 *
 * This module will contain logic and configurations for:
 * - Connection management to exchanges/brokers with low-latency considerations.
 * - Order message construction and parsing with minimal overhead.
 * - Potentially, direct hardware interaction or kernel bypass techniques (conceptual).
 *
 * Expected Benefits:
 * - Reduced time from signal generation to order execution.
 * - Competitive edge in HFT and scalping strategies.
 * - Minimized slippage due to latency.
